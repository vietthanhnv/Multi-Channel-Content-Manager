userSettings: {
  weeklyCapacityHours: number;
  workingDays: string[];
  workingHours: { start: string; end: string };
  customContentTypes?: string[]; // New field
}

// Channel interface updated:
interface Channel {
  // ... other fields
  contentType: string; // Now accepts any string (predefined or custom)
}
```
