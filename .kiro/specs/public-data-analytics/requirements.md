# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouTube Public Data Analytics & Reporting System is an automated weekly reporting system that tracks public YouTube channel metrics without requiring API keys or channel ownership verification. The system enables content creators to monitor multiple channels' public performance data, generate comparative reports, and track progress against growth goals through web scraping of publicly available YouTube channel information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to add YouTube channels to track by simply pasting their URLs, so that I can monitor competitors and channels of interest without needing API access or ownership verification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid YouTube channel URL THEN the system SHALL extract the channel identifier and add it to the tracking list
2. WHEN a user provides an invalid YouTube channel URL THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the addition
3. WHEN a channel is successfully added THEN the system SHALL immediately attempt to scrape initial baseline data
4. IF a channel's public data is not accessible THEN the system SHALL mark the channel as unavailable and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically collect public channel data weekly, so that I can track performance trends without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weekly collection schedule triggers THEN the system SHALL scrape public data from all tracked channels
2. WHEN scraping a channel THEN the system SHALL extract subscriber count, total view count, video count, and channel creation date
3. WHEN rate limiting is detected THEN the system SHALL implement delays and retry mechanisms to avoid being blocked
4. IF a channel becomes unavailable during scraping THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with remaining channels
5. WHEN data collection completes THEN the system SHALL store the metrics with timestamps for historical tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to receive automated weekly reports with performance comparisons, so that I can quickly understand channel growth trends and patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weekly data collection completes THEN the system SHALL generate performance reports for all tracked channels
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL calculate week-over-week growth percentages for all metrics
3. WHEN displaying growth data THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes and trends
4. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL indicate baseline establishment period
5. WHEN reports are ready THEN the system SHALL make them available through the dashboard interface

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to set growth targets for tracked channels, so that I can monitor progress against specific goals and receive alerts when targets are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets a subscriber target for a channel THEN the system SHALL store the goal and track progress
2. WHEN a user sets a view count target for a channel THEN the system SHALL store the goal and track progress
3. WHEN current metrics meet or exceed set targets THEN the system SHALL generate achievement notifications
4. WHEN displaying channel data THEN the system SHALL show progress percentages toward goals
5. IF no targets are set THEN the system SHALL display metrics without goal tracking

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to export channel performance data and generate visual dashboards, so that I can create custom reports and share insights with stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate CSV files with historical metrics for selected channels
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, channel names, and all tracked metrics
3. WHEN generating visual dashboards THEN the system SHALL create charts showing growth trends over time
4. WHEN displaying multi-channel comparisons THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance visualizations
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to handle rate limiting and blocking gracefully, so that data collection remains reliable and doesn't get the application banned from YouTube.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making requests to YouTube THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays between requests
2. WHEN rate limiting is detected THEN the system SHALL exponentially back off and retry after delays
3. WHEN blocked or throttled THEN the system SHALL log the incident and attempt alternative scraping strategies
4. WHEN scraping fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL pause collection for that channel and alert administrators
5. WHEN resuming after blocks THEN the system SHALL use randomized delays and request patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to view trend analysis and performance alerts, so that I can quickly identify significant changes and opportunities in channel performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify growth acceleration, deceleration, and plateau patterns
2. WHEN significant changes occur THEN the system SHALL generate performance alerts with change details
3. WHEN displaying trends THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for positive and negative changes
4. IF anomalous data is detected THEN the system SHALL flag potential data collection issues
5. WHEN viewing alerts THEN the system SHALL allow users to acknowledge and dismiss notifications
