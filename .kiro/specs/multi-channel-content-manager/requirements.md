# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Channel Content Management System is a drag-and-drop workflow management tool designed for content creators who manage multiple YouTube channels simultaneously. The system provides visual time allocation, capacity planning, and progress tracking capabilities while operating entirely client-side using browser localStorage for data persistence. The tool aims to streamline content creation workflows and optimize time distribution across multiple channels with different content strategies and production schedules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator managing multiple YouTube channels, I want to create and organize a portfolio of channels with different content types and posting schedules, so that I can maintain a clear overview of all my channels in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a channel portfolio dashboard
2. WHEN a user clicks "Add Channel" THEN the system SHALL provide a form to create a new channel with name, content type, and posting schedule
3. WHEN a user creates a channel THEN the system SHALL store the channel data in browser localStorage
4. WHEN a user views the portfolio THEN the system SHALL display all channels with their associated content types and schedules
5. IF a user has no channels THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance to create their first channel

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to define different content types with time estimates and create reusable templates, so that I can standardize my content planning process and accurately estimate workload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses content planning THEN the system SHALL display options to create videos, shorts, and posts
2. WHEN a user creates a content type THEN the system SHALL allow setting time estimates for production phases
3. WHEN a user creates a template THEN the system SHALL store template data with content type, duration estimates, and workflow steps
4. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL pre-populate content creation forms with template data
5. IF a user modifies a template THEN the system SHALL update the template without affecting existing content items

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want a visual weekly calendar with draggable tasks, so that I can optimally distribute my time across multiple channels and easily adjust my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the calendar view THEN the system SHALL display a weekly grid with time slots
2. WHEN a user drags a content task THEN the system SHALL allow dropping it on any available time slot
3. WHEN a user drops a task on a time slot THEN the system SHALL update the schedule and persist changes to localStorage
4. WHEN tasks overlap in time THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators of scheduling conflicts
5. IF a user attempts to schedule beyond available hours THEN the system SHALL highlight the overallocation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want smart workload distribution with overload warnings and rebalancing suggestions, so that I can maintain a sustainable work schedule across all my channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system calculates weekly workload THEN it SHALL compare total scheduled hours against user-defined capacity
2. WHEN workload exceeds capacity THEN the system SHALL display warning indicators on affected time periods
3. WHEN overload is detected THEN the system SHALL suggest task redistribution options
4. WHEN a user requests rebalancing THEN the system SHALL propose alternative scheduling arrangements
5. IF rebalancing is applied THEN the system SHALL update the calendar and maintain content deadlines where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want real-time status updates and completion rates per channel, so that I can track progress and identify channels that need attention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user marks a task as complete THEN the system SHALL update the task status immediately
2. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL recalculate completion rates for affected channels
3. WHEN viewing channel overview THEN the system SHALL display current completion percentage for each channel
4. WHEN a channel falls behind schedule THEN the system SHALL highlight it with visual indicators
5. IF all tasks for a channel are complete THEN the system SHALL mark the channel as "On Track"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to export and import my data as JSON files, so that I can backup my work and transfer it between devices without losing my planning data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Export Data" THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all channels, templates, and schedule data
2. WHEN a user selects "Import Data" THEN the system SHALL provide a file picker for JSON files
3. WHEN importing data THEN the system SHALL validate the JSON structure before applying changes
4. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL merge imported data with existing data or replace it based on user choice
5. IF import fails due to invalid format THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages without corrupting existing data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator managing 3-10+ channels, I want the application to work entirely in my browser without external dependencies, so that I can use it offline and maintain control over my sensitive planning data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL function completely without internet connectivity after initial load
2. WHEN data is saved THEN the system SHALL store all information in browser localStorage only
3. WHEN the browser is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL restore all user data from localStorage
4. WHEN localStorage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL provide data cleanup options
5. IF localStorage is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback options
