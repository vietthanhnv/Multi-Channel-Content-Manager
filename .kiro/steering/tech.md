# Technology Stack

## Build System & Framework
- To be determined based on project requirements
- Consider modern web frameworks (React, Vue, Angular) for web-based UI
- Consider Electron for desktop applications
- Consider mobile frameworks (React Native, Flutter) for mobile apps

## Common Technologies for YouTube Creator Tools
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API v3 for channel/video management
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 for YouTube API access
- **Database**: Consider SQLite for local storage or PostgreSQL/MongoDB for cloud
- **Analytics**: Chart.js, D3.js for data visualization
- **Scheduling**: Cron jobs or task queues for automated posting

## Common Commands
Since the project structure is not yet established, these will be updated as the tech stack is chosen:

```bash
# Development
npm start / yarn start          # Start development server
npm run build / yarn build      # Build for production
npm test / yarn test            # Run tests

# Or for Python projects
python -m venv venv             # Create virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install dependencies
python main.py                  # Run application
```

## Development Guidelines
- Use environment variables for API keys and sensitive data
- Implement proper error handling for API rate limits
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use TypeScript for better type safety (if using JavaScript)
- Implement proper logging for debugging API interactions
